    Mobile Dropdown Menu: Dropdown menus that expand and collapse on click, with indicators showing the current state.
    PC Header Dropdown Menu: Dropdowns in the header that show and hide content based on user interaction.
    Product Menu Interaction: Menus that display additional content when clicked, with responsive behavior for different screen sizes.
    Image Sliders: Two sliders that allow users to scroll through images, with draggable functionality and progress indicators.
    Footer Dropdown Menu: Dropdowns in the footer that expand and collapse to show additional information.
    Cookie Consent Box: A cookie consent box that appears if the user hasn't accepted cookies yet, which can be dismissed and remembered.

    Modern CSS Techniques: Flexbox, Grid, and custom properties are used for layout and styling.

Problems:

Finally: 

    what is given in the task, everything is done by hand, without libraries, support tools, just a site built with my own logic, in which I used html, css and javascript.
